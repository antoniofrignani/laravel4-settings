{"name":"Laravel4-Settings","tagline":"Super simple package that allows you to store settings (config) in the database. This does not replace config, just helps it out a little ;) *** WIP ***","body":"Settings Package for Laravel 4\r\n==============================\r\n\r\n*** WIP ***\r\n\r\nI borrowed ideas from several other config/preference/settings packages that exist for L4 that are\r\nalready out there, so this isn't really anything special and it is pretty specific to my needs.\r\n\r\n- Store your config in the database\r\n- Can still retrieve regular config items using the Settings::get() method as well\r\n- Can overwrite config values using the ones that you've stored in the db.\r\n- Other features. I hate doing readmes and it's mostly so I can remember.\r\n\r\n###Using with L4\r\n\r\nStart by adding the following line to your composer.php\r\n\r\n```\r\n'dberry37388/settings' => 'dev-master'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOpen up your app/config/app.php file and add the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// under service providers add:\r\n'Dberry37388\\Settings\\SettingsServiceProvider'\r\n\r\n// under aliases add:\r\n'Settings' => 'Dberry37388\\Settings\\Facades\\SettingsFacade',\r\n\r\nNow open up the command line and run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp artisan migrate --package=dberry37388/settings\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we're cooking with peanut oil... You should be all installed and ready to go now.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Using the Settings Package\r\nThe best way to see what is going on is to open up the code and take a gander, but here is a really\r\nquick cheat sheet.\r\n\r\n## Retrieving a Setting\r\n\r\n```\r\n// no namespace\r\nSettings::get(\"site.name\");\r\n\r\n\r\n// grouped with namespace\r\nSettings::get('site::settings.name');\r\n\r\n\r\n// you can also retrieve anything that you would using Config::get()\r\n// for example if I wanted the app.timezone set in app/config/app.php\r\nSettings::get('app.timezone');\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's all pretty simple :) Now on to setting \"settings\", that is a mouthful\r\n\r\n## Setting Settings\r\n\r\n// no namespace\r\nSettings::set('site.name', 'My Site Name');\r\n\r\n\r\n// grouped with namespace\r\nSettings::set('site::settings.name', 'My Site Name');\r\n\r\n\r\n// you can use standard convention to overwrite any config vars also.\r\n// using our app.timezone example\r\n//\r\n// Note that after setting this, Config::get('app.timezone') will now\r\n// be your new value. This does not overwrite the config file, but it's loaded into memory.\r\n\r\nSettings::set('app.timezone', 'America/Chicago');\r\n\r\n\r\n### Forgetting (Removing)\r\n\r\nYou guessed it, to forget or delete a setting just use:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSettings::forget('my.key.here');\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's it for now. Have fun and enjoy!\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
